# accountR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of accountR is to provide useful tools for accounting and
financial reporting. The tools allow users to convert data frames that
include values of multiple currencies automatically into one
user-defined currency at a specific reporting date. Additionally, it
provides functions to generate a Trade Receivables Aged Analysis report
which can be used to calculate the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts or
other tasks of the Accounts Receivable Management, such as monitoring of
payment collections.

## Installation

You can install the development version of accountR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mschuermann/accountR")
```

## Example for Currency Conversion

This is a basic example which shows you how to convert a data frame full
of different currencies into one currency:

``` r
library(accountR)

data <- accountR::demo_file
result <- 
  FX_rate_convert(data, "currency", "amount", "EUR", "2022-06-30")
#> For full currency exchange rate API documentation visit:
#>  https://exchangerate.host/#/#docs
#>  (this message will only appear once per session)

head(result)
#>   currency company name country customer id invoice no invoice date amount
#> 1      CAD            H  Canada       10019   INV03220   2022-07-11  44577
#> 2      CAD            H  Canada       10019   INV03258   2022-07-13  98807

## Example for the Trade Receivables Aged Analysis report

This is a common example on how to generate a Trade Receivables Aged
Analysis report:

``` r
example_overdue <- aged_analysis(result, "due date", "2022-08-15")
example_report <- aging_report(example_overdue, "translated_amount", "company name", "invoice no")
head(example_report)
#>   Customer Less than 0 0 - 30  30 - 60  60 - 90   Total
#> 1        A    944070.0  75254     0.00  92171.2 1111495
#> 2        B    707494.0      0     0.00  51180.0  758674
#> 3        C    819466.0  11776 38213.00  96240.0  965695
#> 4        D    957180.9      0     0.00 173669.7 1130851
#> 5        E    918706.0  91301 76167.02 400631.7 1486806
#> 6        F    402013.0      0     0.00  92622.0  494635
